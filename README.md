Github repo for personal website

Things to fix:
1. Content in left profile column needs to be responsive while fitting inside container
- look into SASS and prefixers to normalize style across operating systems
2. Projects need to align in the browser window

Features to add:
1. Add technologies/framework icons in the left profile column
2. Add filter buttons for hardwares, softwares and fields
3. Potentially world map with all places I've travelled to in a video or animation
